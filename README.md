This web application allows users to create, view, comment on, and upvote posts across a dynamic forum-style interface. The app emphasizes user interaction and responsive design.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite

This project was built using the React framework with Vite. I created reusable components for the post feed, form inputs, and individual post pages. I implemented a authentication system that assigns a user ID or allows users to set a key to edit/delete their posts. The app also features dynamic routing for post pages, form validation, and a mobile-responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.

The state was managed locally within React, and posts were stored in memory. I also implemented sorting and searching functionality entirely on the client side, giving users flexible ways to explore content.

Lessons Learned:

One of the biggest challenges for me was figuring out how to route the pages correctly. I had learned the topic recently so I was excited to put it into practice but it definitely took me a few tries before I got it to work. However, once I got the hang of it, it became a lot more smooth to implement
